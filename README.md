# Video Search Engine
Welcome to the Video Search Engine project! This is a mobile-friendly web application that allows you to search for videos using the YouTube Data API. Please note that the code for this project has not been shared in this repository due to sensitive information such as the YouTube Data API key.

## Disclaimer
Please be aware that this project contains sensitive information, such as the YouTube Data API key, which has not been included in this repository for security reasons. Therefore, the provided code is incomplete and cannot be used as a standalone project.
Also if you enter an input in the searchbox and it does not give anything, it might be because I am using the free version of YouTube Data API so it has a limit for quotas and so the quotas might have reached its limit. In that case, please let me know so that I can make the necessary changes to make it work.

If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to contact the project me, sadnyani-4.

Thank you for your understanding.
